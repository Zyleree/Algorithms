# Contributing to the Algorithms Collection

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this collection of algorithm implementations! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the overall repository structure.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized as a collection of independent projects, each focusing on specific algorithmic concepts or applications. Each project should:

- Be contained in its own directory at the root level
- Include complete documentation
- Include its own build and run instructions
- Follow consistent code style within the project

## General Contribution Process

1. **Fork the Repository**: Create your own fork of the repository.
2. **Create a Branch**: Make a branch for your contribution.
3. **Make Changes**: Implement your algorithm or fix issues.
4. **Test**: Ensure your code works correctly.
5. **Submit a Pull Request**: Open a PR with a clear description of your changes.

## Adding a New Project

When adding a new project to the collection:

1. Create a new directory at the root level with a descriptive name.
2. Include a comprehensive README.md within your project directory.
3. Implement proper build tools appropriate for the language (Makefile, CMake, etc.).
4. Add your project to the list in the main README.md.
5. Ensure your project includes appropriate tests.

## Project-Specific Guidelines

For contributions to specific projects within this collection, please refer to the individual CONTRIBUTING.md files within each project directory.

## Code Standards

- Write clear, commented code
- Follow the style conventions of the language you're using
- Include appropriate tests
- Document your algorithm's time and space complexity

## Questions?

If you have any questions about contributing, please open an issue with your question.
