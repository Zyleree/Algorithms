# Algorithms Collection

A comprehensive collection of algorithm implementations and related projects for educational and reference purposes.

## Projects

- [Chess-E](./Chess-E/): A C++ chess engine with optimized algorithms for move generation and evaluation
- [ECC Implementation](./ECC%20Implementation/): A Python library for Elliptic Curve Cryptography. It provides comprehensive finite field arithmetic (including prime, binary, and polynomial basis representations), various elliptic curve forms (Weierstrass, Montgomery, Edwards), and cryptographic applications such as ECDSA and ECDH along with key generation and management.
- *More projects coming soon*

## Structure

This repository is organized as a collection of independent projects, each focused on specific algorithmic concepts or applications:

```
